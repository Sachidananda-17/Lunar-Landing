##LunarLander RL Agent
This repository contains a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent implemented in PyTorch to solve the LunarLander-v2 environment from the OpenAI Gym. The agent utilizes a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn how to control the lunar lander and safely land it on the moon's surface.

##Overview
The LunarLander-v2 environment simulates the task of landing a spacecraft on the moon. The agent has control over the craft's main engine and orientation engines to maneuver and land safely. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward while safely landing on the designated landing pad.

##Key Concepts and Components
Deep Q-Network (DQN): The agent's neural network architecture is implemented using PyTorch. It consists of fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions.
Replay Memory: Experience replay is utilized to store and sample past experiences for efficient training. It helps stabilize and improve the learning process.
Target Network: A target Q-network is used to stabilize training by providing more stable target values during the learning process.
Epsilon-Greedy Exploration: The agent balances exploration and exploitation using an epsilon-greedy policy. It selects random actions with probability epsilon and greedy actions based on the learned Q-values otherwise.
Training Loop: The agent interacts with the environment, collects experiences, and updates its Q-network parameters using mini-batch gradient descent.
Metrics
Average Score per Episode: The training process prints the average score achieved by the agent over the last 100 episodes. This metric indicates the agent's learning progress and performance.
Environment Solving: The environment is considered solved when the average score over the last 100 episodes exceeds 200. Upon solving, the training process stops, and the model parameters are saved.
